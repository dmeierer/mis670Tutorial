MIS670 Tutorial

This tutorial is designed to introduce the Scattertext Library by Jason Kessler.

I do not take credit for the library or examples from the library used to help illustrate what Scattertext can do.

The code for the library can be viewed here: https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext.

You must download and run the ipython notebook on your laptop or server.

Note: the html page creation for the kaggle article example takes some time to generate so please wait until the html files show up in the tutorial directory!
